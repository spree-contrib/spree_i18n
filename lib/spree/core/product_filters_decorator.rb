      # Example: filtering by possible brands
      #
      # First, we define the scope. Two interesting points here: (a) we run our conditions
      #   in the scope where the info for the 'brand' property has been loaded; and (b)
      #   because we may want to filter by other properties too, we give this part of the
      #   query a unique name (which must be used in the associated conditions too).
      #
      # Secondly, the filter. Instead of a static list of values, we pull out all existing
      #   brands from the db, and then build conditions which test for string equality on
      #   the (uniquely named) field "p_brand.value". There's also a test for brand info
      #   being blank: note that this relies on with_property doing a left outer join
      #   rather than an inner join.
