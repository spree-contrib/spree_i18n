## Installation

Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'spree_i18n', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_i18n', branch: 'master'
```

Run `bundle install`

You can use the generator to install migrations and append spree_i18n assets to
your app spree manifest file.

    rails g spree_i18n:install

This will insert these lines into your spree manifest files:

In `vendor/assets/javascripts/spree/frontend/all.js`

```
//= require spree/frontend/spree_i18n
```

---

## Model Translations

We **removed** support for translating models into [a separate Gem](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_globalize).

Please update your `Gemfile` if you still need the model translations.

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'spree_globalize', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_globalize', branch: 'master'
```

---

## Upgrading

**WARNING**: If you want to keep your model translations, be sure to add the `spree_globalize` gem to your `Gemfile` **before** migrating the database. Otherwise **you will loose your translations**!

### 1. Migrate your database

    bin/rake spree_i18n:upgrade
    bin/rake db:migrate

*Note:* The migration automatically skips the removal of the translations tables. So it's safe to run the migration without data loss. But be sure to have the `spree_globalize` gem in your `Gemfile`, if you want to keep them.

### 2. Remove Assets

From `vendor/assets/javascripts/spree/backend/all.js`
```
//= require spree/backend/spree_i18n
```

and from `vendor/assets/stylesheets/spree/backend/all.css`
```
*= require spree/backend/spree_i18n
```

### 3. Remove Configuration

Remove all occurrences of `SpreeI18n::Config.supported_locales` from your code.

## Managing Translations

We use i18n-tasks to keep locales normalized with spree upstream.

### Updating Keys with Spree Master

** Beta ** this currently requires a version of i18n-tasks that conflicts with
spree_cmd, over highline versions, i18n-tasks 0.9.0-rc2 or higher must be
installed for the  custom Spree.t parser to work.  Otherwise i18n-tasks will
mangle translations.

``` bash
be rake spree_i18n:update_en # Pulls en.yml from spree/spree master
i18n-tasks add-missing-nil
```

### Normalizing Locales
``` bash
i18n-tasks normalize
```

See i18n-tasks for the rest of the magic
